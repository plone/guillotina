class IField(Interface):
    """Basic Schema Field Interface.

    Fields are used for Interface specifications.  They at least provide
    a title, description and a default value.  You can also
    specify if they are required and/or readonly.

    The Field Interface is also used for validation and specifying
    constraints.

    We want to make it possible for a IField to not only work
    on its value but also on the object this value is bound to.
    This enables a Field implementation to perform validation
    against an object which also marks a certain place.

    Note that many fields need information about the object
    containing a field. For example, when validating a value to be
    set as an object attribute, it may be necessary for the field to
    introspect the object's state. This means that the field needs to
    have access to the object when performing validation::

         bound = field.bind(object)
         bound.validate(value)

    """

        """Return a copy of this field which is bound to context.

        The copy of the Field will have the 'context' attribute set
        to 'object'.  This way a Field can implement more complex
        checks involving the object's location/environment.

        Many fields don't need to be bound. Only fields that condition
        validation or properties on an object containing the field
        need to be bound.
